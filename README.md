Launch/restart your application and that's it: metrics are being collected.

To expose metrics Don't forget to also add one of [Yabeda adapters](https://github.com/yabeda-rb/yabeda#available-monitoring-system-adapters) to your Gemfile.

### Releasing

1. Bump version number in `lib/yabeda/activerecord/version.rb`

   In case of pre-releases keep in mind [rubygems/rubygems#3086](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/3086) and check version with command like `Gem::Version.new(Yabeda::ActiveRecord::VERSION).to_s`

2. Fill `CHANGELOG.md` with missing changes, add header with version and date.

3. Make a commit:

   ```sh
   git add lib/yabeda/active_record/version.rb CHANGELOG.md
   version=$(ruby -r ./lib/yabeda/active_record/version.rb -e "puts Gem::Version.new(Yabeda::ActiveRecord::VERSION)")
   git commit --message="${version}: " --edit
   ```

4. Create annotated tag:

   ```sh
   git tag v${version} --annotate --message="${version}: " --edit --sign
   ```

5. Fill version name into subject line and (optionally) some description (list of changes will be taken from changelog and appended automatically)

6. Push it:

   ```sh
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

7. GitHub Actions will create a new release, build and push gem into RubyGems! You're done!
